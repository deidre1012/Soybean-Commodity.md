As we look back in time on one of the United States’ largest crop, the soybean, we see that its time in the U.S. is fairly short.  Unlike corn, soybean has was introduced to the U.S. in the late 1700s, but not making its bit hit until the beginning of the 20th century.  Originating in China, the soybean was domesticated around 1100 B.C.  Making its way through Europe and England, the soybean eventually found its way into the U.S.  As it progressed throughout the 1800s, farmers began to notice the different climates it was able to endure, and thanks to George Washington Carver, it is a great crop to route with to improve soil quality.  In 1919, the American Soybean Association was officially founded.  Now thirty-one states have some kind of soybean production, with the four main leaders being Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Minnesota (NC Soybean).  Throughout the last one hundred years, soybean has grown into one of the largest crop produced in the United States.  The United States produces 90% of the world’s oilseed production (Walls, 2018).  Soybean has many uses.  It is used for rotation of crops, soybean oil, sauces, livestock feed, and more.  Due to the wide variety of uses, soybean has a higher demand than other crops.  In order to have a higher rate of soybean production farmers can plant a range of 100,000 seeds to 200,000 of soybeans per acre based on the width of each row (Pardue Extension).  Also, farmers have gradually began to plant a few weeks earlier to help control the issue of pesticides, weathering, and cost of production.  Weather is a large factor that can affect the crop season for farmers.  As for the 2018 season it looks like the early part of the season will receive much rain, but stay cooler than normal.  Yet the latter part of the season will be more dry and much hotter causing the farmers to control water supply much more carefully (Farmer’s Almanac).  Farmers today not only are trying to focus on the impacts of the weather on their harvest and yield, but also the political impact.  Just a few days ago, President Trump passed a 1.3 trillion dollar bill addressing agricultural topics.  The agricultural industry is unsure the long term effects of the bill, but as of now it has assisted in the livestock industry and rural areas (Successful Farming).  Thus, the soybean industry will likely see an affect from the bill within the near future.
As we look into the cost of the soybean production based on the Chicago Board of Trade, there are 5,000 bushels in one contract.  Similar to corn the soybean is a quarter of a cent per bushel.  If the soybean is a quarter of a cent per bushel then a contract totals out to be $12.50.  In 2017 alone, 4.39 billion bushels of soybean were harvested, which increased about two percent from the year before (USDA).  USDA also stated that the average area that harvested soybean was a record at almost 90 million acres.

I plan on buying December 2018 contracts based on the increasing percentage of the beginning stocks and decreasing exports. I will be selling 10 contracts to begin and see where the market goes.  By buying 10 contracts at a price of $12.50 each that will total out to be $125.  Thus, making each contract worth $1,250, making the total trade cost $1,375.  As the predetermined marginal price is at $0.04, it may force me to sell. However, if the market takes a continual decline, then I will have to buy more contracts.  At a starting amount of $100,000 and buying 10 contracts at a total of $1,375, I will be left with an amount of $101,375.
